            \(I\) and voltage \(V\) of an electrical device

    %         \item all except the ideal model are implicit, meaning they cannot be solved
    %         explicitly for \(I\) or \(V\) \\
    %         \(\implies\) I-V curve can be interpreted as a
    %         zero level set \(f(V, I) = 0\) contained in the first quadrant
    %         \item only a single point from the simulated I-V characteristic is needed to
    %         formulate a prediction
    %         \item this point ideally corresponds to the operating point
