This chapter introduces the physical model used in this thesis.
This so-called five-parameter model is one of several physical
models discussed in the literature. The chapter begins with a
brief review of these models. Understanding their application 
involves two key concepts covered in distinct sections:
operating conditions and current-voltage characteristics.
The operating conditions are the input parameters for the
physical models. In real-world scenarios, these often need
to be estimated from meteorological data, as is the case in
this thesis. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristic is a
graphical representation of the relationship between the
current and voltage of an electrical device. The physical
models aim to characterize the I-V characteristics
of the PV device under study. The chapter concludes with a
description of how the presented physical model can be
applied to simulate arbitrary configurations of PV systems,
given certain assumptions.
