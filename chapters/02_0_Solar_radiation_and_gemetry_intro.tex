A key input variable for the physical model presented in this thesis
is the irradiance received by an arbitrarily oriented surface on Earth.
Estimating this variable from global horizontal and diffuse horizontal
irradiance data relies on a transposition model. The
formulation of this model requires a solid understanding of the
Sun's position relative to Earth's surface
and oriented planes, as well as foundational knowledge of solar
radiation modeling. The following sections cover these basic concepts
and introduce a well-known transposition model used in this
thesis at the end of this chapter.
