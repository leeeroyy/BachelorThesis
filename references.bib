  abstract = {This article presents the modelling and experimental verification of the operating current of a 120W of mono-crystalline photovoltaic module using four- and five-parameter analytical models. The southern part of Turkey, where the experimental system is mounted, is particularly well suited to photovoltaic installations. The operating current of the photovoltaic module, calculated from the models, is validated based on a series of experimental measurements. As well as the current and voltage of the photovoltaic module, the environmental variables such as ambient temperature and solar irradiance were measured and used for validation of the operating current. The photovoltaic cell models considered in this article are drawn from the equivalent electrical circuit that includes light-generated current, diode reverse saturation current, and series and shunt resistances. The simplified four-parameter model assumes the shunt resistance as infinite and thus neglects it. After determining the model parameters, the operating current is calculated using both models and compared to the measured current produced by the photovoltaic module. It is shown that the complete five-parameter model predicts the operating current better than the simplified four-parameter model, especially around solar noon, when most of the power is produced.}

  abstract = {The electricity produced from renewable energy, in particular from wind and photovoltaic plants, has seen exponential rise in the last decade. Consequently, the prediction of power produced from these plants is fundamental for the reliability, safety and stability of the grid. This paper compares three physical models describing the PV cell (corresponding to three-, four- and five-parameter equivalent electric circuit) and two thermal models for the cell temperature estimation (NOCT and Sandia). The models were calibrated and tested towards ten monocrystalline and eight polycrystalline modules installed at SolarTechLab at Politecnico di Milano. The hourly error of the forecasted power output is usually lower than 15Wh, while NMAE% and WMAE% are in the range of 0.5% and 10%. Low errors, calculated with actual weather conditions, suggest that the implemented models are accurate, but they cannot be directly compared with other approaches which adopt weather forecasts. Results show that there is no clear advantage of using complex models, but the data used for the model calibration mostly affect the model accuracy. It was found that forecasted power output are more accurate using experimental data and Sandia’s thermal model in monocrystalline cells type, while for the polycrystalline the data from the manufacturer and NOCT have lower errors.}

  abstract = {Based on high-accuracy irradiance measurements at a high-elevation station frequently affected by snow cover, this experimental study evaluates the interannual variability in high global tilted irradiance (>1 sun) incident on either latitude-tilt (40°) or vertical-tilt (90°) radiometers at 1-min resolution. Using a 10-year time series, this variability is found substantial, particularly for the 90° tilt. The performance of five separation and seven transposition models is also analyzed in general, and most specifically under cloud and/or albedo enhancement events. The separation models’ performance degrades rapidly for clearness indices larger than 0.8, to the point that three models tend to predict zero direct normal irradiance when it is actually high. Only one model (Engerer) can predict acceptable results, even though negatively biased under such conditions. All transposition models are also impacted by enhancement events. This is most particularly the case for one of them (Perez), which tends to predict an extremely low sky-diffuse component during those events, and even negative values in the case of the 90° tilt. An analysis of the models’ performance as a function of the clearness index reveals that most models are affected by a rapid degradation of performance when this index is larger than 0.8. For the 40° tilt and on average over 10years, the bias of the CDRS model is found reasonably low and stable even when the index approaches its maximum value. The maximum recorded value of GTI is ≈2000Wm−2 (2 suns) for the 40° tilt, using 1-s data. For the 90° tilt, no model has a low and stable bias under all possible conditions, but the CDRS model still performs reasonably well under high clearness index conditions. All these findings confirm the fact that separation or transposition models that were empirically developed based on hourly irradiance data do not necessarily respond correctly to transient enhancement situations.}

  abstract       = {The recent global warming effect has brought into focus different solutions for combating climate change. The generation of climate-friendly renewable energy alternatives has been vastly improved and commercialized for power generation. As a result of this industrial revolution, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have drawn much attention as a power generation source for varying applications, including the main utility-grid power supply. There has been tremendous growth in both on- and off-grid solar PV installations in the last few years. This trend is expected to continue over the next few years as government legislation and awareness campaigns increase to encourage a shift toward using renewable energy alternatives. Despite the numerous advantages of solar PV power generation, the highly variable nature of the sun’s irradiance in different seasons of various geopolitical areas/regions can significantly affect the expected energy yield. This variation directly impacts the profitability or economic viability of the system, and cannot be neglected. To overcome this challenge, various procedures have been applied to forecast the generated solar PV energy. This study provides a comprehensive and systematic review of recent advances in solar PV power forecasting techniques with a focus on data-driven procedures. It critically analyzes recent studies on solar PV power forecasting to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques or models implemented. The clarity provided will form a basis for higher accuracy in future models and applications.},

This paper presents critical evaluation of the parameters extraction of two diode PV model using three EA methods, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE). For DE, two variations are proposed: (1) boundary based differential evolution (B-DE) and (2) penalty based differential evolution (P-DE). The performance of each method is evaluated based on several factors: accuracy and consistency of solution; speed of convergence; computational efficiency and the required number of control parameters. Comparisons are carried out using synthetic data and are validated by six PV modules of different types (multi-crystalline, mono-crystalline, and thin-film) from various manufacturers. Information derived from these critical evaluations can be useful to determine the best computational method to build an efficient and accurate PV system simulator.}

The main contribution of this work is the simplification of the current equation, in which only four parameters are required, compared to six or more in the previously developed two-diode models. Furthermore the values of the series and parallel resistances are computed using a simple and fast iterative method. To validate the accuracy of the proposed model, six PV modules of different types (multi-crystalline, mono-crystalline and thin-film) from various manufacturers are tested. The performance of the model is evaluated against the popular single diode models. It is found that the proposed model is superior when subjected to irradiance and temperature variations. In particular the model matches very accurately for all important points of the I–V curves, i.e. the peak power, short-circuit current and open circuit voltage. The modeling method is useful for PV power converter designers and circuit simulator developers who require simple, fast yet accurate model for the PV module.}

ANN results are compared with analytical four and five parameter models of PV module. The inputs of the models are the daily total irradiation, air temperature and module voltage, while the outputs are the current and power generated by the panel. Analytical models of PV modules, based on the manufacturer datasheet values, are simulated through Matlab/Simulink environment. Multilayer perceptron is used to predict the operating current and power of the PV module. The best network configuration to predict panel current had a 3–7–4–1 topology. So, this two hidden layer topology was selected as the best model for predicting panel current with similar conditions. Results obtained from the PV module simulation and the optimal ANN model has been validated experimentally. Results showed that ANN model provide a better prediction of the current and power of the PV module than the analytical models. The coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values for the optimal ANN model were 0.971, 0.002 and 0.107, respectively. A comparative study among ANN and analytical models was also carried out. Among the analytical models, the five-parameter model, with MAPE=0.112, MSE=0.0026 and R2=0.919, gave better prediction than the four-parameter model (with MAPE=0.152, MSE=0.0052 and R2=0.905). Overall, the 3–7–4–1 ANN model outperformed four-parameter model, and was marginally better than the five-parameter model.}

A few inputs are only needed for the model, which can be obtained from the manufacturer datasheet. With this newly developed model, the performance of a PV module/string/array at any solar irradiance and module cell temperature can be easily simulated. To validate the simulation model, the parameters from the simulation and I–V characteristic curves were compared with those from the DeSoto model and other simulation software (INSEL and PVsyst) at different temperature and irradiation. The comparison results present a high degree of agreement. Moreover, a series of field measurements were carried out from an existing 22kWp grid-connected PV system located in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University to further validate the simulation results at a wide range of real operating conditions. To have more realistic results, the model was then slightly modified by including the effect of soiling, aging and other derating factors. Field test results demonstrate that the modified simulation model can accurately predict the I–V curve characteristics of PV modules/strings/arrays demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of the developed simulation model.}

  abstract = {Only few manufactures provide the wide set of graphical data that are necessary to use high performance predictive tools for PV systems. On the other hand, reliable graphical data require accurate laboratory measurements that increase manufacturing costs. For this reason PV system designers have to choose between the use of cheap PV modules, lacking in technical data, and the reliable energy predictions that are possible only if the current–voltage characteristics are provided by the PV module manufacturers. This paper describes the procedure to evaluate the parameters of a one-diode equivalent circuit able to accurately represent the electrical behaviour of a PV panel by means of the minimum set of technical data that are usually provided by all manufacturers. To reach the purpose some correlations based on the survey of more than one hundred PV module characteristics were defined to make up for the lack of technical information. The computer routines used to evaluate the values of the model parameters are listed; the routines are written in BASIC and can be easily implemented, even like VBA macros in Microsoft Excel. The capability of the new model to calculate the current–voltage characteristics was tested by comparing the results with data measured by four different manufacturers. The results of the application of the new model confirm the reliability of the proposed procedure. The differences between the calculated and the measured data are always less than the data tolerance usually declared by the manufacturers.}

This model features a simple geometrical sky hemisphere description, allowing for the observed effects of forward-scattered and back-scattered radiation and a parameterization of insolation conditions based on available radiative quantities. Model performance is studied through (1) long term independent tests performed against hourly ground-shielded tilted irradiance data from Trappes, France; Carpentras, France and San Antonio, Texas; (2) long term dependent tests performed against hourly data from the same stations plus Albany, New York; and (3) real time tests based on one-minute data from Albany, New York. Performance is assessed through comparison with three reference models: the isotropic, the Hay, and Klucher anisotropic models. Substantial performance improvement over the three reference models is found for all stations and all surface orientations. Additional performance improvements from independent to dependent testing can be explained logically on the basis of climate, altitude and latitude differences between stations.}

This model is one of those used currently to estimate short time step (hourly or less) irradiance on tilted planes based on global and direct (or diffuse) irradiance. It has been shown to perform more accurately than other models for a large number of locations worldwide. The key assumptions defining the model remain basically unchanged. These include (1) a description of the sky dome featuring a circumsolar zone and horizon zone superimposed over an isotropic background, and (2) a parameterization of insolation conditions (based on available inputs to the model), determining the value of the radiant power originating from these two zones. Operational modifications performed on the model are presented in a step by step approach. Each change is justified on the basis of increased ease of use and/or overall accuracy. Two years of hourly data on tilted planes from two climatically distinct sites in France are used to verify performance accuracy. The isotropic, Hay and Klucher models are used as reference. Major changes include (1) the simplification of the governing equation by use of reduced brightness coefficients; (2) the allowance for negative coefficients; (3) reduction of the horizon band to an arc-of-great-circle; (4) optimization of the circumsolar region width; and (5) optimization of insolation conditions parameterization.}

  abstract = {The Perez 1990 transposition model has emerged as the preferred choice for estimating global tilted irradiance, also known as plane-of-array irradiance. One notable drawback is the Perez model’s reliance on empirical coefficients assigned to discrete bins of the sky clearness parameter, resulting in discontinuities in the calculated tilted irradiance. In this study, we present a novel method to eliminate the discontinuities of the Perez model by replacing the empirical look-up table with a set of six quadratic splines. This is facilitated by transforming the unbounded sky clearness parameter (epsilon) to an equivalent bounded parameter (zeta). Transposition using the original Perez model and continuous Perez–Driesse model are compared for multiple orientations at two locations. The two models produce very similar deviation statistics, meaning the continuous version can be used as a plug-in replacement for the original. Reverse transposition is demonstrated using the Perez–Driesse model together with a new continuous version of the Erbs diffuse fraction model and a simple bisection solution search. This combination achieves a substantially higher success rate than the GTI-DIRINT algorithm in our tests.}

  abstract = {Transposition models convert the solar irradiance received on a horizontal surface to in-plane irradiance. All transposition models to date, unfortunately, only produce deterministic (as oppose to probabilistic) estimates. In modern energy meteorology, having the entire predictive distribution is more desirable than relying only on deterministic estimates. To that end, this paper outlines two strategies for creating probabilistic transposition models (PTMs), that can quantify the various types of uncertainty involved in the modeling process. The first strategy seeks the analytic expressions of measurement, model, and parameter uncertainty, and the final predictive variance is the sum of these three types of uncertainty. On the other hand, the second strategy directly models the overall uncertainty as a whole, and uses ensemble model output statistics to estimate the predictive distribution through optimizing a loss function. Both strategies generate estimates of tilted irradiance with Gaussian predictive distributions. As compared to their deterministic counterparts, PTMs clearly offer more insights on uncertainty quantification, during solar energy system design, simulation, performance evaluation, and power output forecasting.}

The single-diode model has been derived from the well-known equivalent circuit for a single photovoltaic (PV) cell. A cell is defined as the semiconductor device that converts sunlight into electricity. A PV module refers to a number of cells connected in series and in a PV array, modules are connected in series and in parallel. The modification presented in this paper accounts for both parallel and series connections in an array. Derivation of the modified current–voltage relationships begins with a single solar cell and is expanded to a PV module and finally an array. Development of the modified current–voltage relationship was based on a five-parameter model, which requires data typically available from the manufacturer. The model accurately predicts voltage–current (V–I) curves, power–voltage (P–V) curves, maximum power point values, short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage across a range of irradiation levels and cell temperatures. The versatility of the model lies in its accurate prediction of the aforementioned criteria for panels of different types, including monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon. The model is flexible in the sense that it can be applied to PV arrays of any size, as well as in simulation programs such as EMTDC/PSCAD and MatLab/Simulink. Accuracy of the model was validated through a series of experiments performed outdoors for different configurations of a PV array.}

This is particularly true in the case of buildings with integrated photovoltaics (PV) systems having a wide range of orientations and inclinations defined by the skin of the building. Since solar radiation data at the plane of interest is hardly ever available, this study presents the analysis of two of the most representative transposition models used to obtain the in-plane irradiance using as input data the global and diffuse irradiation on the horizontal plane, which can be obtained by satellite-based models or ground measurements. Both transposition models are validated with experimental measurements taken in Murcia (southeast of Spain) and datasets provided by the photovoltaic geographical information system (PVGIS) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for vertical surfaces facing the four cardinal points. For the validation, the mean bias deviation, root mean square error and forecasted skill were used as indicators. Results show that the error rate decreases slightly for clear days. Better results are also obtained by dismissing data with low solar elevation angles so as to avoid shadowing effects from the surroundings in the early and late hours of the day, which affects mainly the performance of the transposition models for west and east surfaces. The results highlight the potential of equator-facing façades in winter time when the received irradiation can be twice as much as the one collected by the horizontal plane. It is also noteworthy that the operating conditions of all façades are mainly low irradiance and medium temperature at these locations.},

A test rig was developed in Hong Kong to assess the PV power outputs of ten PV modules. The solar radiation, ambient temperature and power generation are recorded. The evaluated models include simple efficiency model, temperature correction model and one-diode model. The results show that the mono-Si PV module is the highest in terms of the annual energy outputs per unit area, and a-Si PV modules is the lowest. The simple efficiency model overestimates the power output of all types of PV modules for more than 10% except for a CdTe PV module. The one-diode model demonstrated the highest accuracy for mono-Si and poly-Si PV modules. The accuracies of the evaluated models are low for thin-film PV technologies. Although the mean bias error of the one-diode model is larger than 10% for the thin-film PV modules (expect for one CdTe PV module), the one-diode model has the highest accuracy among the three models. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the energy performance of thin-film PV modules and then improve their prediction accuracy.}
